This example shows complex data mapping and how to make those tables in knex.
It has seeds, migrations, config and knexfile
The basicModelTemplate is outdated, look to another example for refinement
basicRESTCallTemplate should not be used in other projects, it was an experiment that proved to make the code less flexible and more obfuscated
basicCRUDFunctionsTemplate and basicCRUDRouteTemplate are good examples and should be used
basicModel needs to be given a type; it's used in basicCRUDFunctionsTemplate
